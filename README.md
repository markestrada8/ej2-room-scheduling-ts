# Creating a Meeting Room Calendar Using the Syncfusion JavaScript Scheduler

A meeting room calendar displays a list of conference rooms in a corporate office with quick overview to the available rooms. Other than the reserved time slots for meeting purpose, the common unavailable timings such as lunch break and maintenance works of those meeting rooms will be blocked and unaccessible to anyone. This application has been built completely by making use of the [quick start](https://github.com/syncfusion/ej2-quickstart.git) TypeScript project.

It has been developed by making use of the [multiple resources](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/schedule/resources.html?lang=typescript) feature of scheduler component.

## Calendar functionalities

The multiple resources functionalities incorporated in this sample application are,

* **[resources](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/schedule/resources.html?lang=typescript)** - Defines the resource data. Here, the meeting room data is provided as dataSource.
* **[group](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/demos/#/material/schedule/group.html)** - Allows the scheduler layout to group the resources physically. Here, 5 rooms are displayed visually on the same scheduler.
* **[byDate](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/demos/#/material/schedule/group-bydate.html)** - Allows grouping of all the meeting rooms date-wise.
* **[resourceHeaderTemplate](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/demos/#/material/schedule/group-custom-work-days.html)** - Allows customization of resource header cells. Here, the header row is customized by displaying the room names accompanied with its capacity and type.
* **[allowGroupEdit](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/demos/#/material/schedule/group-editing.html)** - Allows the same appointment to be shared by more than one resource. Here, the `lunch break` and `maintenance` appointments are the grouped one and are made read-only.
* **[Client-side events](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/demos/#/material/schedule/events.html)** - Events such as `actionBegin`, `renderCell`, `popupOpen` and `eventRendered` has been used in this application for achieving major customization of scheduler as well as in achieving the room reservation functionality.
